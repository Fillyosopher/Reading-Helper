# What is it?
See the following for a visual representation of Bionic Reading, which inspired this: https://twitter.com/juanbuis/status/1526900107379105793/photo/1

# Installation Instructions:
- unzip (or git clone) the file somewhere
- Open Chrome Extensions
- In the upper right, turn on developer mode
- Click Load unpacked
- select the folder, it should load as Reading Helper
- Go to the upper right and click the puzzle piece to show the extension (which will look like a Grey Square with a White R)

# To Use:
- when you want to run this against a page, click the extention button and it will convert the page

# Other:
If anyone wants to fork this and actually upload it to the Chrome Dev store, please go for it!  This was the work of 3 hours, has many issues, and isn't something I plan to refine much.  I'd be quite happy if someone else took it and made something better!
