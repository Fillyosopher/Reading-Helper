# Installation Instructions:
- Click the green Code button above, then click "Download ZIP"
- unzip the file literally anywhere
- Open Chrome Extensions
- In the upper right, turn on developer mode
- Click "Load Unpacked"
- Select the folder, it should load as Reading Helper extension
- Go to the upper right and click the puzzle piece to show the extension (which will look like a Grey Square with a White R)

# To Use:
- When you want to run Reading Helper against a page, click the extention button and it will convert the page

# Other:
If anyone wants to fork this and actually upload it to the Chrome Dev store, please go for it!  This was the work of 3 hours, has many issues, and isn't something I plan to refine much.  I'd be quite happy if someone else took it and made something better! (This entire extention is ~100 lines of text, it's EASY to modify.)
